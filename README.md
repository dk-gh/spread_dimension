## The Spread Dimension of a Metric Space

Spread dimension of a metric space was defined by Willerton in
<i>Spread: A measure of the size of metric spaces. International
Journal of ComputationalGeometry & Applications, 25(03):207â€“225,
2015.</i> <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1209.2300>.

The spread and spread dimension are also introduced in the n-Catgory
Cafe blog post:
